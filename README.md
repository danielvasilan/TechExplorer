#### Project description

(Phase 1) 
The implementation has been done by customizing a previous solution, for a similar company (same business domain)
The covered areas were: 
* Article (including BillOfMaterials, Routings, technical information)
* Receipts
* Pricing (standard, manufacturing, sales)
* Production declarations
* Shipments
* Invoicing
* Reporting
* Data loading from excel, csv or pdf files 

(Phase 2) 
The UI was recreated using Oracle Apex
The business logic remained in the same schema as it was for the VBA application.
A new schema for the APEX application contains views for the objects in the production schema and instead-of triggers that calls the business logic from the proper package
